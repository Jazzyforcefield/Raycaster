## Assignment 1C
# Introduction
In this portion of the assignment we extend the functionality of our raycaster to be able to
draw triangles. Additionally, smooth shading and textures are implemented.

# How to Use
There is a makefile inside the folder. You should run: `make` in order to create an executable
called `gen_image`. Then you can do `./gen_image <location_of_input_file>` in order to run the
program. The .ppm image will be generated in the folder that the input is in.
